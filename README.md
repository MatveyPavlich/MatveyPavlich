## Matvey Pavlich 

**Systems programming enthusiast • C / C++ • OS dev • Databases**

I’m building my foundations in low-level computing by writing things from scratch — operating system components, a toy database, and small compilers/parsers.  
My long-term goal is to work on real database engines and storage systems.

### 🎯 What I’m working on
- **SnakeOS** — a small x86_64 operating system (bootloader → paging → interrupts)
- **mkdb** — a toy database exploring pages, B-Trees, and simple query execution
- **Mini-compiler experiments** — lexers, parsers, ASTs in C
- **Data structures and algorithms** — do a bit of [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/matveypavlich) from time to time
